# Covid19-Data-Exploration with SQL

### Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis affecting millions of lives worldwide. The outbreak has caused a massive influx of data related to the number of new cases, total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. The purpose of this project is to explore  COVID-19 dataset using SQL to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

### Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL. 

  **The specific objectives are:**

      - To identify the total number of cases, new cases, and deaths globally and region-wise.
      - Get inforamtion of vaccination.
      - To identify the relationship between the number of cases and the death rate.
      - To find any  trends and patterns in the data and their significance.
      
### Methodology:
The project uses SQL to perform exploration of COVID-19 data. The dataset includes all COVID-19 related information, such as the number of new cases, total cases, deaths, and vaccines. The project uses SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset, perform data exploration.

### Expected Outcomes:
The project is expected to provide insights into the COVID-19 data, such as the trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. The exploration is expected to identify the regions most affected by COVID-19, the impact of vaccination rates on the number of cases, and the relationship between the number of cases and the death rate. 

### Conclusion:
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a massive influx of data related to the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations. This project aims to explore  the COVID-19 dataset using SQL to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. The project is expected to provide valuable insights that will be useful for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in managing and controlling the pandemic.
